# Snapmaker 2.0 - Simplify3D Profiles

This repo contains Simplify3D slicer profiles specifically made to be used by Snapmaker 2.0 3D printers.

These profiles are exported as config bundles and then split into the specific parts. As such, to import them choose "File" > "Import" > "Import Config Bundle" and import each config. It will not work if you choose "Import Config".
